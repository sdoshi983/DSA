// this is the code to check if there exists a cycle in a directed graph using depth first search

// CODE:

bool isCyclic(int node, vector<vector<int>>& graph, vector<int>& visited){
    if(visited[node] == 2)
        return true;
        
    visited[node] = 2;
 
    for(auto vertex : graph[node]){
        if(visited[vertex] != 1){
            if(isCyclic(vertex, graph, visited))
                return true;
        }
    }
    
    visited[node] = 1;
    return false;
}


/*
- Algorithm:
 - visited[i] = 0 means the vertex is unvisited
 - visited[i] = 1 means the vertex is processed
 - visited[i] = 2 means the vertex is in processing in the current dfs call
 
 - on each recursive call, we check if visited[node] = 2 then there is a cycle because value 2 indicates that this node was visited before but in the same recursive stack
 - so after the loop for all graph[node] is over, we change the value of visited from 2 to 1. This indicatest that this vertex is fully processed.
 - hence we don't do the dfs call for the vertices with the visited[vertex] value equal to 1
