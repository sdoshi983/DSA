/*
Uses:

- helps in knowing whether two nodes are of same connected component or different.
- combines two disconnected components in a single connected component
- Compress jumps along a segment / Painting subarrays:
    - There is a set of vertices, and each vertex has an outgoing edge to another vertex. With DSU you can find the end point, to which we get after following all edges from a given starting point, in almost constant time.
