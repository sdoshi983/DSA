- Bookish definiton:
  - A Bipartite Graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided into two independent sets, U and V such that every edge (u, v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex from   V to U. 
  - In other words, for every edge (u, v), either u belongs to U and v to V, or u belongs to V and v to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects vertices of same set.
  
  
- Simple and more clear definition
  - A graph is bipartite graph if all the vertices of this graph can be colored with excatly 2 colors such that no two adjacent vertices have same color
  - Here, two vertices are known as adjacent if they have a direct edge between them
  
- Observation or Coding approach
  - if the graph has an even length cycle, only then it can be a bipartite graph
  - if the graph has an odd length cycle, it cannot be a bipartite graph
